# Terraform 101 

This repo and class wee will explore terraform, a tool from Hashicorp. Terraform comes from the latin of ' Terra ' which means earth and 'forma' which means form/change.

The naming convention is because the tool is used to orchestrate our infrastructure and is part of IAC (infrastructure as code)

IAC:
* Configuration Management tools
* Orchestration tools

#### Configuration Management tools
Tools include: Chef, puppet, and Ansible
--> Helps us to create imutable infrastructure


#### Orchestration tools
Terraform, cloudform and others.

The conjunction of the two, allows us to define our infrastructure as code.

Along with version control - such as git - it allows us to maintain and maniupulate infrastructure in ways that were not possible before.
